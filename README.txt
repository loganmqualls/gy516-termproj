Bulk and individual linear models are run on a specified hydrological region in the CAMELS dataset and the r-squared values returned from the models are used to track how well the models perform. This work highlights model improvement with the addition of lagged precipitation and lagged streamflow data in the bulk/individual multiple linear regression models.
